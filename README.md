# Study-Time-Identifier
program used to help students identify their study needs for this semester
Problem #1: 	How much should I study outside of class?

Students of the school need help identifying the amount of study hours they need per week to earn the grades they are striving for. The program will ask their full name and the number of credit hours they are enrolled in. Plus, they will input the grade they want to earn for all the classes as one entry. The program will compute the given data to find the required study hours. The program will display the student name, credits, study hours, and the grade working towards. This program will repeat for all the students until the user enters “n” or “N” in begin prompt. After the program will compute the total number of students, the average of credits hours taking by the group of students using the program and the average number of study hours.
